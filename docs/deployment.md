# Deploying our app to Heorku
To deploy our app, we will use [Heroku Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/). [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) will allow us to deploy our NodeJs app quickly and without having to pay.

Create an account with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), if you havn't already.
Once logged in, Heroku will take you to your apps page, where you can find the apps that are currently running on Heroku.

***

## Setting up Heroku CLI
Heroku CLI will allow us to deploy our app, from our termianl. Using the CLI is a quick and effective way to continuously deploy your web apps.
> Note: Make sure you have Git installed, before you install Heroku CLI.

### Downloading the CLI
Download and install Heorku CLI:
- [MacOs](https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku.pkg "Heorku CLI Donwload for MacOS")
- [Windows](https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe "Heorku CLI Donwload for Windows")
- Ubuntu: Run `sudo snap install --classic heroku`

After installing the CLI, open terminal in your project directory.
run `rm -rf node_modules; npm install --production`
This will ensure that you only have the packages you need for production on you project, before you deploy your app.
![npm init](/assets/images/config15.png"Running npm init")
This will generate a package.json file in our project.
`rm -rf node_modules; npm install --production`

### Installing Heroku's npm package
Then, we will install Heorku's npm package globally
`npm install -g heroku`

To verify the installation you can run this command:
`heroku --version`
You should see heroku/ in the output.

***

## Configuring Heroku settings
Heroku will require us to change a few settings in your package.json file. First, let's specify our engin.

### Setting up our app engin.
Add the lines below, to the end of your package.json file, to tell Heroku what engin you want, running your Node application.
~~~
"engines": {
    "node": "10.x"
  },
~~~
This will help Heroku, recognize the version of the Node you are using.

### Setting your npm start command
Inside your package.json, add this code to your scripts section:
~~~
    "start": "node server.js"
~~~

At the end, my package.json file is going to look like this:
~~~
{
  "name": "TwitterAPI",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "10.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "description": ""
}
~~~
***
## Pushing your app
Now, you will push your app to your Heroku repository.
### Preparing for deployment

Run `npm install` to install and update all of your dependencies.

Start your app locally using the command below:
~~~
heroku local web
~~~
This command is installed as a part of Heroku CLI.
![Running locally](../assets/images/config16.png)
Press `Ctrl+C` to exit

### Loging into Heroku in CLI
After installing the CLI, run `heroku login`. This will open a browser windows, where you can login to your Heorku account. With logging in, you will be able to deploy your app from your command line.

### Deploying
Add, commit your code to Heroku:
~~~
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
~~~
Then, run the command below, to create a remote for your Heroku:
~~~
heroku create
~~~
This will create a remote for your Heroku repository.
Once created, you can push your code into your Heroku repository:
~~~
git push heroku master
~~~
You can visit the app by running `heroku open`.

# Twitter Standard API User Guid

## Theme
We created this guide with [Just-the-Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Github pages theme. We selected the theme because it outlines the documentation in detail, and will provide the editor with the set of tools needed for writing user documentations. It autogenerates pages and navigation, based on the file structure. It, also, contains complete syntax-highlighting for code blocks. 

## Style guide 
We used [Adobe I/O Style Guide](https://github.com/adobeio/styleguide/blob/master/opensource/doc-style.md) as our style guide. We chose the style guide, over many others, because it is designed to conduct clear and easy-to-undrestand API documentations. It requires a explanatory, yet instructive writing, while giving the author(s) the freedom to choose the flow of the text, as needed.

## Editors
This document is written and edited by:
- Parsa Safavi
- Gurmeet Sandhu

## Communication methods
We communicated using [Slack](https://slack.com/) throughout the project. Each of us aggreed to work on multiple sections. We regularly touched bases and made sure that each of us knew what the other member was working on. Also, [Zoom Video Conferencing](zoom.us) was our tool for having online meetings.

## Learning outcomes
Since we were not familiar with the content of this document, we had to learn using the Twitter API, when working on the document. Although this made the project more challanging, we had already discussed and predicated the challange before choosing our subject. At the end, the project helped us learn working with Github pages, markdown documents, just-the-docs theme and the Twitter Standard API itself.

## Roadblocks
The most difficult challange was undrestanding of Twitter API and transferring that knowledge into comprehensible sentences. Explaining the consept of OAuth and the steps required for setting it up, consumed much of our time, spent on the project.
